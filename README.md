# spatial_hardness_distribution_in_rcf
In this repository one will find the complete series of images which illustrate all Weibull probability of failure plots for all spatial gradient combinations of type, depth and operating conditions (residual stress and contact pressure).

The naming convention of the images is as follows:
* "p{Hertzian Pressure} _ rs{Peak Residual Stress Magnitude} _ {Depth with respect to half-contact width, b} .tiff"

Where:
* {Hertzian Pressure} which takes values of 2.00 GPa, 3.50 GPa
* {Peak Residual Stress Magnitude} which takes values of -200 MPa, -400 MPa
* {Depth with respect to half-contact width, b} which takes values of 1b, 2.5b, 5b, 10b
